The worker reported that in childhood she had an osteochondroma in the same knee, currently healed and without sequelae, performing the last control X-ray two months ago, which was completely normal.
The worker related this episode to a work accident suffered two days ago, in which while carrying a box with 32 mercury thermometers in his hand, he slipped and fell to the ground.
Some mercury thermometers fell on his right knee and produced a contuse-insert wound, which we still observed in the exploration in a state of healing.
The nursing assistant acknowledges that she had overload in her job.
The box in which the thermometers were carried was not closed, the worker did not wear gloves and the working clothes were not removed after the occupational accident.
Subsequently, no hygienic-sanitary measures were taken and no adequate action was taken against mercury spills.
In the emergency department, the next step was to perform a radiograph of the knee, objectifying a metallic foreign body in bursa, corresponding to mercury.

36 cm of dental arch identifies a small, well-defined, cystic anechoic lesion that seems to depend on the submucosa of 14 x 6 mm of maximum diameter.
The ultrasonographic study did not identify the presence of abdominal or mediastinal lymph nodes and the integrity of the vascular axis was demonstrated.
Once the lesion to be punctured was identified, an ultrasound study with color doppler was performed to avoid vascular formations and to identify the most appropriate path to perform the puncture.
The Echotip Wilson needle is used for this puncture. First, the needle sheath is removed a few centimeters through the working channel until it is visualized either gastroscopically or ultrasoundally.
Once verified its position inside the lesion, the stylet is removed (which is used to prevent possible contamination of the sample) and maneuvers are performed to advance the needle in order to extract the material as much as possible.
In our case, we used an aspiration syringe to increase the cellularity of the sample.
Two steps are taken on the lesion until the pathologist, present in the examination room, confirms the sufficiency of the sample.
1.
Diff-Quick (Merck) staining was used to evaluate the sample in the examination room and the cytological study was completed with Papanicolau staining (Merck).
Cytological examination showed abundant foamy histiocytes with scarce cydrical epithelium consistent with cyst gastric duplication cyst.

Two days before he was in the emergency room where he was diagnosed with UTI, and antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was started without improvement.
The physical examination showed an axillary temperature of 38.2o C. The rest of the examination was completely normal, including rectal examination that showed a prostate size III/IV, not indurated and slightly painful.
An important leukocytosis of 41800 with neutrophilia (93%), a glucose of 337 mg/dl, a platelet count of 394000, a fibrinogen index of 771 were noteworthy in the blood analysis performed.
Pyuria and microhematuria were observed in the urine sediment and no pathology appeared in the simple X-rays of thorax and abdomen practiced.
Abdominal ultrasound showed no pathology.
With the suspicion of UTI, she was admitted to the Urology Department and intravenous antibiotic treatment was instituted after obtaining an urinocultive.
The chosen regimen in this case was the combination of ceftriaxone 1 g plus tobramycin 100 mg every 12 hours.
On the third day of admission and due to the clinical and analytical improvement of the patient, it was decided to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy, continuing with cefuroxime-axilla.
On the seventh day, and coinciding with the arrival of the hemocultives and urinocultives enrolled at admission and who were informed as negative, the patient presented a fever peak of 39o C. and a new elevation of leukocytes.
We decided to restart the intravenous antibiotic therapy and perform a v-prostatic ultrasound in which the patient's great prostate (400 cc.) stood out.

The suspicion that it could be an acute prostatitis in the context of a BPH was suspected. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was continued and a Millin type Adecision was scheduled when the infectious clinical symptoms disappeared.
Despite antibiotic therapy, the evolution continued to be unfavorable, the fever peaks persisted, so the treatment regimen was changed introducing levofloxacin i.v. culture instead of ceftria.
Despite the change in antibiotic treatment, the patient continued to present fever and worsening of the general condition so it was decided to perform a transrectal ultrasound to rule out the presence of any complication, in which there was a poorly defined area of abscess medial doechogenic.

Pathological findings were established and a transrectal ultrasound guided puncture of the abscess was performed, obtaining about 20 ml of purulent material, which was sent to microbiology.
Prostate and pus exudate cultures were positive for E. coli.
Despite the puncture, the patient continued with septic symptoms and did not report any improvement. A CT was performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out abscess complications.
CT showed an increase in the size of the prostatic gland with a multilayered liquid collection located caudally to the gland.

Because CT findings failed transrectal puncture, a transvesical prostatectomy was performed.
After opening the capsule, we could appreciate the total destructuring of the gland, with the presence of multiloculation and purulent material inside, as well as extensive areas of apical prostatic necrosis that compromised the tissue urethra.
Pathology showed two small foci of microacific adenocarcinoma, very distant from the resection limits, with Gleason 2 + 3 and acute prostatitis and hyperplasia complicated with large nodular necrosis areas.

Specifically, 4 mammograms and 2 breast ultrasounds were performed between May 2006 and April 2009, with no evidence of abnormalities suggesting damage to the integrity of the prosthesis.
In March 2010, a new breast ultrasound was performed, in which a cystic ovoid image not previously reported was visualized on the anterior surface of the breast prosthesis. Therefore, the radiologist decided to practice a MRI.
This procedure was performed one month later and a nodular image was observed in the prosthesis, located in the area of internal interquarter, about 2.5cm in diameter, which showed no signs of inflammatory rupture or rupture of liquid content.
In different sections, it seemed as if an elongated, hook-shaped structure was introduced inside the prosthesis, similarly to how a finger was introduced into a balloon in a half-hynk.
The patient reported no symptoms.
1.
Such data on images should be explored surgically, considering the possibility of being forced to remove the breast prosthesis.
It was initially thought that perhaps the fat infiltrate could have been introduced into the prosthetic capsule and pushed the stent without breaking it, creating a deep tunnel in its interior.
During surgery, it was found that the prosthesis seemed to be intact, and that within the capsule there was no tissue that could alter the shape of the implant.
In the area of the capsule that was in contact with the site where the fat infiltrate occurred, there were no alterations, but corresponded to malignant tissue despite biopsy of the injected fatty tissue area; this fibrotic biopsy without signs in the histological study.
When removing the prosthesis to examine it, we pay attention to the fact that within it there appeared several opaque spots scattered in different places, without linear distribution, which could make us think that it was a needle.
However, at a point close to the largest of them, after performing strong compression of the prosthesis, we saw that the cohesive silicone of the implant was slightly herniated.
We decided, after removing it, to open it and send samples of the material inside it.
The implant removed was replaced with another of the same characteristics.

Biopsy renal outcome shows significant glomeruli with a completely distorted structure due to a hyaline deposit nodular arrangement, with positivity for Congo and timilosis in red vessels; tubules are compatible and not with thymylosis.
The paraffin-embedded sample showed marked positivity for AP protein, which is part of the amyloid substance common in all types of amyloidosis, with negativity for light chains and AA proteins.
Fibrinolysis with antibodies against fibrinogen and lysozyme is performed, resulting in amyloid substance deposits positive for A alpha chain of fibrinogen (Afib).
However, in the genetic study no mutation was found in the Afib chain gene, and a previously undescribed mutation in the apolipoprotein AI gene (apo AI) was demonstrated.
This discrepancy is analyzed by biopsy of the mother, which contains glomerular deposit in the cortex and massive deposit at the medullary level.
Medullary deposit is not described in amyloidosis Afib, being very characteristic of apo AI.

The large dilation of small bowel loops greatly reduces the workspace required to manipulate surgical instruments by laparoscopy.
This fact, together with the risk of perforation when handling the necrotic loop, as well as the impossibility of safely identifying the anatomical structures, requires a conversion to open surgery.
The conversion is performed by means of an iterative infraumbilical laparotomy and it is seen that the cause of the obstruction and malformation of the ileon uterus is an internal hernia through the leaves of the broad ligament.

The patient abandons antibiotic treatment and the follow-up at 6 months due to social problems, despite the persistence of disease in the cultures.
One year after diagnosis, medical treatment was restarted and maintained for one year with adequate clinical follow-up.
An intravenous urography was performed, with a diagnosis of right massive kidney and stenosis of the last cms of the left ureter.
Right nephrectomy was performed and an attempt was made to reinstate the left bladder neck during which there was left disinsertion to 1 below the left junction ureter, which was decided by permanent urethrotomy.

Physical examination and orthopantomography showed a bone-dependent tumor of 5-6 cm in diameter, with involvement of both cortical bones, which extended from the region of the second premolar ipsilateral muscle to the middle of the mandibular ramus.

A facial computed tomography (CT) was performed, which showed a mandibular tumor lesion of 5.5 × 4.8 × 3 cm. The right ramus was preserved, affecting the internal mandibular cortex and displacing the muscles and structures of the base of the major tongue.
A diagnostic biopsy was performed, resulting in myxoid lesion with reactive lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory component, with positivity for vimentin, CD138, Kappa, Lambda and partial positivity for actin.
Immunohistochemistry showed negativity for S-100, CD31 and CD68.
The diagnosis was mandibular odontogenic myxoma.
1.
Under general anesthesia and nasotracheal intubation, surgical excision of the lesion was performed with margins, using a combined intra- and extraoral approach, performing segmental hemimandibulectomy from the mandibular region to the mandibular arch ipsilateral.
The patient presented a dentate contralateral hemimandible.
Primary reconstruction was performed using free microvascularised fibular graft.
The maximum thickness of the fibula was 14 mm. The flap was preformed in situ, with the carving of the new hemimandible by means of a reconstruction bar modeled on the original mandible, and fixation mini-plate.
Vascular anastomosis was performed between the right peroneal and facial arteries, and between the concomitant veins peroneal and right thyrolingual-facial venous trunk.
The histological study of the piece was reported as mandibular odontogenic myxoma without involvement of surgical margins.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
After one year of the intervention, observing a height discrepancy between the fibula and the alveolar ridge of the contralateral hemimandible of 17 mm, it was decided to perform a vertical osteogenic distraction of the fibula.
1.
Distractor placement was performed under general anesthesia.
The fibular graft was exposed by means of an incision in the buccal oral mucosa, after which a subperitic dissection proceeded to adequately visualize the underlying lingual bone, giving extreme care to the periosteum.
The intraoral alveolar distractor (MODUS ARS 1.5; Medartis®, Basel, Switzerland) was placed on the buccal surface of the fibula to correctly design osteotomies.
Osteotomies were performed on the fibular buccal surface using an oscillating saw with saline irrigation.
A trapezium bony segment was obtained and the periosteum lingual remained intact.
Alveolar distractor was fixated on both sides of the horizontal osteotomy.
After verifying the perfect functioning of the distractor, it was arranged in its starting position, so that both bone fragments were in perfect apposition.
This is essential to initiate bone formation from the position of maximum contact between fragments and to achieve adequate hemostasis post-steotomy.
The vestibular incision was closed leaving part of the distractor through the incision, in order to facilitate its activation.
1.
Distractor activation was not performed during the latency period (10 days).
After this, the procedure was performed at a rate of 0.5 mm daily.
Vertical distraction of the peroneal bone and formation of bony trabeculae in the interface were observed at the end of stabilization in serial orthopantomised controls (obtained weekly).
17 mm of bone were obtained in 34 days, so that the fibular graft reached the same level as the contralateral alveolar ridge, with an optimal correction of the initial height discrepancy between them.
1.
The consolidation period lasted three months, during which the distractor was maintained at its initial fixation site.
Orthopantomography at three months confirmed an excellent ossification between the basilar and the distracted fragment.
Subsequently, in a second intervention, the distractor was removed using the same intraoral approach.
The quality of the newly formed bone, macroscopically verified, was excellent.
In the same intervention, three screwed titanium implants (3.75 × 15 mm) were placed in the distracted area.
Good primary stability was achieved in all implants.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
Prosthetic rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses was successful after three months of osteosynthesis.

After six years of follow-up, an analytical control showed immunophenotype of peripheral blood compatible with LLP.
This finding was later confirmed with a bone marrow aspirate in which it was observed that in chronic lymphoproliferative syndrome of small cell line B, compatible with quiescent LLP treatment, this time was not due to chemotherapy.
A year later the patient had persistent proteinuria of 4.7 g/24 h, so it was decided to perform a new renal biopsy that confirmed the presence of a glomerulonephritis cryoglobulinemic lymphocytic involvement and also showed low grade lymphocytic lymphoma.
Because of the renal involvement caused by lymphoma, it was decided to start treatment with rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 subcutaneously (s.c.) x 4 and plasma exchange.

She reported diarrhea with episodes of steatorrhea, constitutional syndrome and epigastric pain of two months duration.
The patient was admitted to the emergency department with progressive jaundice, choluria and acholia.
Physical examination revealed good general condition, malaise, normohydration and cutaneous-mucosal irritation.
Abdominal examination revealed the gallbladder to be obstructed and the rest of the abdomen was anodyne.
Analytically, he presented a hyperbilirubinemia of 17 mg/dl, with an increase of AAFC (2522 U/l) and γGT (107 U/l).
No leukocytosis.
Viral hepatitis markers were negative and there was an increase in CEA (7.6 ng/dl).
AFP and CA19.9 were normal.
Ultrasound showed minimal dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct and slight dilation of the bile duct; the gallbladder was hydropic and without stones.
A round, hypoechoic mass was observed in the head of the pancreas of approximately 2 cm, which was not confirmed in the CT, which, as additional information, described dilation of the duct of Wirsung.
Magnetic resonance cholangiography showed similar findings with clinical suspicion of ampuloma that was not evident on gastroscopy, which was strictly normal.
With the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice gastrectomy of probable malign origin, she was operated on one week after admission, finding a mass in the head of pancreas of neoplasic aspect, so a pancreatoduodenum was performed.
In the anatomopathological study the surgical specimen showed two areas of tumor aspect, clearly differentiated.
One of 1 cm and well-defined limits in the duodenal wall, and another of undefined edges of 3 cm in the pancreatic head.
1.
On microscopic examination, the duodenal tumor was composed of cords of polyhedral and uniform cells located in the muscular fascicles of the wall.
They showed nuclei with low degree of atypicality and very low mitotic activity.
Pancreatic tumor was formed by glandular structures located above the walls of the duodenum which were covered by columnar cells with very atypical nuclei and high mitotic index.
1.
Once the diagnosis was oriented.
Immunohistochemical techniques were applied to confirm the different nature of both tumors.
The resulting immunophenotype clearly differentiated both tumors, since the duodenal tumor was negative for CEA and positive for chromogranin, STH and glucagon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma was only positive for CEA.
After the immediate postoperative period in the ICU, the patient was discharged home after 19 days of intervention and went to the surgery ward.
She was given an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen based on gemcitabine 1 g/m2, in four cycles, one of seven weeks and three of three weeks intercaling a rest.
He recovered well during the first months but later he developed persistent right hypochondrium pain, nausea and vomiting.
Since the radiological examinations are anodyne, the patient was reoperated nine months after the first intervention, confirming recurrence, which was unresectable.

The patient's medical history did not reveal any medical history of interest; he did not follow any medication daily, except antibiotics and medications, due to the current problem, was not a smoker and was in perfect health conditions.
1.
After clinical examination, an orthopantomography was requested as the first diagnostic test.
In this work, we can observe how the apex in question finds an apex in close relationship with the canal of the NDI, detecting curvature as clear indicators of high risk of nerve injury during distal canal extraction.
Although orthopantomography showed a fairly clear image, request CT to correctly plan the case before deciding on the therapeutic procedure.
The CT images show that the contact between the cord and the IDC is real and that, therefore, the risk of damage during extraction is high.
1.
Given this situation, we inform the patient of the possibility of performing a coronectomy or partial extraction of the symptomatic third molar.
With this technique we intend to eliminate the clinic caused by pericoronaritis, since we achieve a direct closure of the wound and roots, including the integrity of the IDC.
The patient was informed of the possibility of an infectious complication of pulpal cause, which would force us to reoperate to complete the extraction.
Reentry would also be necessary if, in the long term, there was migration of roots, and these roots returned to generate clinical pericoronaritis due to exposure.
Only if this occurs, the relationship of roots with the NDI would probably not be as clear, nor would extraction, therefore, be so compromised.
After obtaining informed consent from the patient, we proceeded to the coronectomy following the following surgical technique : Administration of antibiotic prophylaxis.
Perform a bayonet incision and lifting of a full-thickness flap similar to that used for complete removal of a cord.
Cutting the crown with a fissure burr from the vestibular table, following an assemblage of approximately 45o.
This section is complete in order not to exert force on the roots with the buttons, which requires careful when approaching the lingual table in order not to injure the lingual nerve.
Later, more dental tissue is still eliminated, with the same fissure burr or with a round burr seized from the upper part.
The latter is a bit easier than with the fissure burr.
The section thus remains at least 3 mm below the bone crests.
This is intended to make it easier for the bone to grow on the roots and to englobe them within the jaw.
The exposed root surface should not be treated.
Finally follicle remnants are eliminated, without mobilizing roots, remaining tooth and suture the wound with loose points that are removed in one or two weeks.
Controls should be performed monthly, at six months and annually.

She was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, with a decrease in proteinuria after 7 months of treatment up to 1.1 g/day, but with proximal muscle weakness that was interpreted as steroid myopathy.
Prednisone was discontinued and switched to mycophenolate mofetil 1 g/day. Prednisone was withdrawn due to its potential influence on edema, adding 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide due to poor blood pressure control.
At 2 months, mycophenolate was discontinued because the patient experienced significant tiredness that she attributed to this drug.

Physical examination revealed the entrance orifice of the projectile in the left iliac fossa with exit through the left glue, with abdominal pain and signs of peritoneal irritation mainly in the hypogastrium and iliac fossa.
There was no involvement of external genitalia or urethrorrhagia.
After urethrovesical catheterization, intense macroscopic hematuria was observed.
At admission, only anemia (Hb: 9.2 g/dl) was detected, and the rest of the biochemical parameters, blood count and coagulation were normal.
Given the hemodynamic stability of the patient, it was decided to complete the study by imaging tests prior to surgery.
Given the theoretical trajectory of the projectile (as soon as the entrance and exit orifices are known), with the suspicion of bladder injury by firearm and given the possible involvement of other organs, it was decided to perform abdominal CT with contrast).

With these findings, exploratory laparotomy was decided.
With the patient in the supine position, a supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy was performed.
Initially, a small mesosigma perforation without sigmoid loop was repaired and a minimal iliac vein lesion affecting the left iliac vein was repaired, showing the rest of the iliac axis posteriorly.
Anterior mid-longitudinal cystotomy was then performed and a double bladder perforation was observed, corresponding to the entrance orifices (4 cm in bladder bottom) and exit orifice (1-2 cm in left retromectile region).
Left ventricular ejection fraction in the left distal ureter with 5F ureteral catheter was found to be completely deinserted in its intramural portion and the projectile in its course was also found
It was decided to suture the double bladder perforation in two planes, after debridement of devitalized edges and perform ureteral reimplantation with transvesical technique and double J catheter (26 cm/6 F) distal end of the ureteral wall.
After closure, also in double plane, of the anterior longitudinal cystotomy, an urethrovesical tube and double closed drainage of aspiration type were left: one at the intraperitoneal level and the other extraperitoneal bladder suture, separated from the line.
Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed: ceftriaxone 2 grams every 24 hours and Metronidazole 1.5 grams every 24 hours, with favorable initial postoperative course.
On the 5 day the patient presented deterioration of general condition, hypotension, fever and leukocytosis with marked left shift (31% fallen).
Antibiotic therapy is replaced empirically, waiting for the result of the hemocultives by Imipenem 500 milligrams every 6 hours intravenous, significantly improving the patient both clinically and analytically.
An E. coli extended spectrum, sensitive to Imipenem, grows in hemocultives.
A new abdominal-pelvic CT scan is performed, which only shows post-surgical changes, showing the existence of dusty liquids causing the septic picture.
The rest of the postoperative period was uneventful, and both drainages were initially removed and the urethrovesical catheter was removed on the 10th day.
Finally, the patient was discharged after completing 10 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy.
It is replaced by ciprofloxacin 250 milligrams every 12 hours orally, according to the previous antibiogram, until the JJ catheter is removed.
One month after the operation, the patient returned to our service for urethrocystoscopy and removal of JJ catheter.

She's the biggest of two sisters.
Separate pages.
She lives with her mother and sister.
During his childhood he highlights attention deficit and poor academic performance without repeating course.
Currently, she begins to attend a higher education module and collaborates in family business.
As a medical history of interest, there is a delay in isolated growth that required treatment with growth hormone (growth hormone) from 12 to 17 years.
Digestive intolerance to corticosteroids associated with bleeding and lactose intolerance.
Genetic testing is performed in childhood, with no genetic, numerical or structural changes being observed.
She denied toxic consumption.
Among the family psychiatric history, the mother reported long-term anxious symptoms.
They describe the father as a lonely, introverted person, and ""poor emotional"", characteristics that present several family members per paternal line.
From the psychiatric point of view, the patient in contact with CSMIJ at 14 years old, being the diagnostic orientation of Social Phobia.
At 17 years of age she was admitted to the Day Hospital for 2 months due to difficulties in relationships, school absenteeism and great dependence on the family environment.
The diagnostic orientation was Social Phobia and Personality Disorder (according to the discharge and evolution) toward a partial improvement.
High introversion is highlighted among the premorbid personality traits.
Her mother describes her as an isolated, ""different"" girl, with little social interest.
The initial examination revealed a distant contact, a little spontaneous language with no formal alterations.
Moderate psychophysical anxiety, obsessive hypochondriac ideas, onychophagia and nocturnal bruxism.
No symptoms of the affective or psychotic sphere were observed.
No changes in the course or content of thought.
No changes in sense perception.
Partial consciousness disorder.
The picture is oriented as a Personality Disorder C (phobic, obsessive and dependent features).
Pharmacological treatment is maintained from CSMIJ (Sertralina, 100 mg), and is derived to psychology to work social difficulties.
He made few visits with poor compliance with the proposed strategies (cognitive-behavioral model), and is disconnected by incompatibility with studies.

Second contact within two years
The patient recovered after almost two years (20 years) of no follow-up.
Social difficulties persist.
An exploratory visit was made by psychiatry and psychology, including a visit to the mother.
They express the decision to abandon SSRI medication.
They do not accept pharmacological treatment, but psychological treatment.
During the assessment, the patient was more impressed by a ""peculiar"" contact than by usual fructose-anxious contact.
You have an extraneous -although subtle- change in eye contact
Language continues to be little spontaneous.
In addition to social difficulties and little interest in the environment, obsessive hypochondriac ideas and absolute rejection by physical and sexual contact stand out.
In order to assess the patient's difficulties/skills at the interpersonal level, simple social exposure exercises are proposed out of consultation.
The patient does not perform any of the proposed exercises.
There is also no concern about solving these difficulties.
On the contrary, it impresses a certain indifference to the matter.
Associated with this, doubts begin regarding social avoidance (wrong vs. anxious?), and regarding the desire to relate socially (the social discourse learned?).
These doubts raise the suspicion that these symptoms could be explained by other diagnoses: schizoid traits? Autism spectrum traits?; therefore, a new evaluation of the patient is proposed.
1.
Evaluation protocol and results thereof:
• Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (SCID II):
- Schizoid Personality Disorder Criteria: 4/5.
Near the cut-off point.
- Avoidable Personality Disorder Criteria: 5/5.
Cut-off point.
• Theory of Mind Tests (TOM):
- ""Happe Histories Test"": It shows an adequate capacity to infer mental states in others, to understand metaphors and double senses.
- ""Mental in Eyes Reading Test"": It is capable of attributing to most elements (23/36) the adequate feeling or emotion shown in the photograph.
- the Pata's Fear Test correctly identifies foot-and-mouth disease stories but shows difficulties in attributing emotional states and intentionality to the characters.
• Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III): Verbal CI= 99 Manipulative CI= 94 Total CI= 97 Rank: Mean
• Revised autism diagnosis interview (ADI-R): Alterations in reciprocal social interaction are identified.
Limited variety of facial expressions to communicate and regulate social interaction.
Inability to develop peer relationships
There is a lack of socio-affective reciprocity, inadequate social responses and a deficit in the search to share pleasure with others.
Retroactively, qualitative alterations in communication are identified, such as lack of spontaneous and varied symbolic play.
Some restricted behavior patterns are also identified.
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): a skull fracture within normal limits.
1.
Overall Assessment:
During the examination, the patient was shown to be a collaborating but unmotivated patient.
The information obtained allows objective signs of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in which there is little social interest, expressions and unsuitable behaviors, difficulties in establishing social relationships with peers, facial expressions and limited affectionate interests.
The cognitive profile and the performance in the domains 'TOM' (number of non-signifi cant errors, although difficulty in attributing emotional states and intentionality to the high character in the test ''Meteduras').

S0004-06142008000300012-1,"A 41-year-old woman with no history of interest presented with diffuse abdominal pain of greater intensity in the epigastrium of 1 week duration, together with nausea, bilious vomiting and poor general condition.
Pain increases with cough and inspiration.
She reported no fever or dysthermic sensation.
No coluria or acholia.
On physical examination the patient is conscious and oriented, affected by pain and impressive of gravity.
Mucocutaneous Pallor.
Patient afflicted and normotensive.
Cardiopulmonary arrest with no findings.
The abdomen was free of masses or enlargements, with generalized abdominal pain due to palpation, more intense in the epigastrium, with no signs of peritoneal irritation (Murphy negative).
No collateral circulation was observed.
No lower limb edema.
No signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Analytically, the patient presented normal biochemical transaminase increase (GOT: 146 U/L, GPT: 171 U/L).
Hemogram with hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL, hematocrit: 34%, leukocytes: 12700 without neutrophilia and platelets: 291000.
Hemostasis with INR: 1.3 and cefalin time 53.3 sec.
A CT scan showed a fat-density thrombus extending from the left kidney to the left renal vein (LRV), inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium ostium.
Free suprahepatic veins.
No complete occlusion of the IVC lumen.
Unspecific pancreatic head abnormality.
1.
Because of this last CT data together with the intense epigastralgia, it was decided to perform an abdominopelvic echo: liver and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct normal.
Lipoma in IVC.
Signs and symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis.
Free fluid in the pelvis, perihepatic, perisplenic and right perirenal spaces (in greater amounts than in previous CT scans).
A differential diagnosis between biliopancreatic disease vs. Budd-Chiari syndrome was made, so it was decided to perform a second CT scan showing bilateral pleural effusion, thickening of gastric folds extending the portal vein ostomy with increased IVCA.
There are images suggestive of hepatic congestion: hepatomegaly, increased caliber of the portal and suprahepatic veins with delay and the arrival of contrast to them, periportal edema, spleen and pancreas retrograde and abundant fluid.
1.
With a presumptive diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to thrombus in the vena cava, paracentesis under ultrasound guidance is performed in order to rule out with greater certainty the peritoneal infectious/tumor process as a cause.
A transudate analytical result was obtained discarding peritoneal process.
Transesophageal ultrasound showed good ventricular function without intracardiac thrombus, with free tricuspid and pericardial effusion.
Finally, with a diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to vena cava thrombus (AML vs. Lipoma), and due to clinical worsening of the patient with poor general condition, emergency surgery was decided upon 48 hours after admission.
QUIRITY INTERVENTION.
It is a thrombus with surgical level IV presenting supradiaphragmatic situation reaching the right atrium ostium.
An incision was made and the retroperitoneum was accessed by opening from fixed loop to Winslow hiatus to allow complete ascending release of the intestinal package, including ligation of the inferior mesenteric vein Che.
Hepatic mobilization is achieved by seccioning the ligaments, coronary stenosis, right and left and sickle cell.
The left kidney and its corresponding hilium are then released, starting with the release of the vena cava, starting at the infrarenal level and ascending to the suprahepatic level with control of the right renal vena cava.
Thrombolysis was performed to the infradiaphragmatic segment.
Liver clamping (Pringle maneuver), proximal and distal IVC and RRV was performed with subsequent cavotomy and opening VRI, complete thrombus extraction and left nephrectomy.

S1135-76062009000300004-1,"A 19-year-old male in a military uniform was found in the supine position with both limbs above the sides of the body, in an open night setting.
On the left forearm a weapon of manufacture and military use was identified: the Fusil body with automatic spasmolata clam - FAL, model No 50-63, supercompact with a folder and abutment.
The place of the event and the clothes of the victim were found without signs of violence.
The deceased patient had blunt tears in his oral cavity, abundant epistaxis, otorrhea and a large blood spot below his head.
1.
After performing the protocols to fix the site of the event, the body was rotated to corroborate the existence of a supposed exit orifice in relation to the large blood spot under the wound edge, identifying a regular cervical level.
The presence of a cavity in the terrain corresponded perfectly with the skull and perforation on land in direct connection with the supposed exit orifice.
The probing of this perforation allowed the establishment of a depth of approximately 20 cm with an estimated depth of narrowing between the oral cavity and the cervical orifice, right-to-left direction, bellow-arm.
The location of the perforation is determined by the projection.
1.
During the autopsy procedure in the morgue and given the lesions of bucco-maxillo-facial involvement, the harmful elements were described as follows:
1.
A large contuse lesion in the oral cavity with periorificial tear in both margins and a stellate shape, with marked destruction to the right side of the individual.
Pigmentation - grayish pigment deposits throughout the oral mucosal cap, most marked on the left jugular mucosa.
A large tear was identified throughout the lingual body with identical presence of the pigment.
In the most posterior and lateral left sector at the junction of the hard palate, blade and isthmus of the fauces circular perforation of 1.5 cm in diameter and intense hemorrhage was observed.
With regard to hard structures, a maxillary and mandibular fracture was observed at the junction of their respective central and lateral walls, with displacement and significant mobility of fracture cables toward the right side.
No direct or indirect dentoperiodontal lesions were found in maxillary teeth.
Regarding the mandibular teeth, the lower right central axis was intact but avulsed and displaced towards the mandibular basal line in the fracture line, while the lateral dentinal substance loss with same side evidenced fracture line.
The missing tooth fragment was identified at the depth of the line mandibular fracture, on the same side as the central avulsed fracture line.

2.
Circular perforating lesion with regular edges of 1.5 cm in diameter located in the midline slightly to the left at the posterior cervical level about 3 cm below the occipital eminence, partially hidden by the hair.
Macroscopic examination revealed the absence of metallic particles.

3.
The passive probing of the tract established the communication between the perforation described at the depth of the oral cavity, in the left posterior sector, with the orifice at the cervical level establishing a rectilinear direction slightly from right to left tongue velocities.
No metallic residues were identified in this path.
In view of the morphology odontosin of both orifices, a tongue wedge was obtained, which was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and in Cordoba, with routine technique of inclusion in paraffin and hematoxylin color.
The identification of particles caused by defecation of the powder embedded between the striated lingual muscle bundles and the absence of these in the exit orifice made it possible to confirm the oral cavity as a point of entry.
1.
Toxicological analyses were negative for both alcohol and drugs.
The absence of signs of struggle (both in the scene and in the subject's clothing), the location and number of wounds, the direction and distance of the shot and the spasm in the left hand determined the determinant medical event.

S1130-01082007000400016-1,"We report the case of a 73-year-old patient who presented with jaundice and constitutional syndrome of less than 2 months duration.
In the Emergency Department a great painful hepatomegaly was evident and the analytical tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and mixed alteration of the cholestatic profile with less normal hepatic insufficiency and AST and GGT more than 10 times.
1.
Twenty-four hours after admission the patient developed confusional state that rapidly progressed to coma and fever greater than 39 oC.
Abdominal ultrasound and CT were performed, showing multiple space-occupying hepatic lesions, hypodense solid, distributed in both lobes occupying almost the entire organ, suggesting MTS.
No infectious focus was found, several hemocultives were sterile and the presence of brain lesions had been ruled out by CT.
1.
Analytically, the hepatic profile deteriorated, presenting a significant increase in transaminase levels in the range of acute hepatitis (ALT and AST > 20 times the normal value with a significant increase in LDH) and data of progressive liver failure.
Despite its rapid consequence established due to antiencephalopathy measures, vasoactive drugs, broad-spectrum antibiotics at high doses (to cover the CNS as a possible focus) and fresh frozen plasma transfusion, the patient died 5 days after admission.
For this reason a clinical autopsy was performed.
The necropsy confirmed the existence of extensive hepatic MTS.
The primary tumor was a cecal adenocarcinoma of 3 x 2 cm in diameter, stage D Dukes and IV Astler-Coller.
